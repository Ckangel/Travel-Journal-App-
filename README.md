# Travel-Journal-App-
designed to help users capture and preserve their travel experiences in a simple, interactive way. Users can create entries that include text notes, photos taken with the phone’s camera, and location tags using GPS. These entries are stored locally so they remain available even after the app is closed or the phone is restarted.
